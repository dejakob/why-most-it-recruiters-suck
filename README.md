In the last two decades, IT became extremely popular in the business world. For years, the amount of jobs increased faster than the amount of candidates. Since there’s a gap between the positions and the candidates, companies are taking huge effort and spending a tremendous amount of money on finding the right employee. This effect also became a market for the recruitment sector. Some years ago, there was a ‘big bang’ of specialised IT recruitment services.

In my personal opinion, those services are pretty unnecessary. Besides that, I strongly dislike the ‘typical IT recruiter’. To explain why and what they’ve ever done wrong to me: let me take you on a magical journey.

## IT recruiters know nothing about IT
Most people recruiting in the sector have no experience with computer science whatsoever. You would think ‘that’s fine, that’s not their job’ and to be completely honest here, nobody expects them to have all the knowledge. It’s just a little bit strange when someone is recruiting ‘Front End Developers’ and has no idea what the difference is between Front End and Back End.

The difference shortly explained:

- Front End Development, also known as client side scripting, is everything of a web experience the user experiences himself. Everything that is basically running on his or her phone/laptop/watch…, either visible or not, is Front End. Web technologies heavily used for client side scripting contain HTML, CSS, JavaScript and lots of variations built on top of those (AngularJS, ReactJS, Backbone, SASS, LESS).
- Back End Development, also known as server side scripting, is all magic happening on servers the user doesn’t have access to. Storing data in a database, analysis on that data and sending emails are just some examples of what happens on the server side. Web technologies heavily used for server side scripting include PHP, MySQL, ASP, JSF, MongoDB, CouchDB, Perl, Python, NodeJS and many more.

In emails and job offers of recruiters I have read:

- “… front end technologies such as PHP, JavaScript, Drupal and CSS"
    - CSS and JavaScript are indeed Front End, PHP is not. Drupal is a layer running on PHP, is also not Front End and became pretty unpopular lately.
- “… You can make rich web applications in Java..."
    - Java is *NOT* the same as JavaScript.
    - JavaScript is scripting, running on an engine (for example Google Chrome’s V8) and is mainly used in browsers, but also on servers (NodeJS). The code is human readable and can run without compilation.
    - Java is a pretty old programming language used to create some desktop applications, android apps and has also other variations such as JSF. All code written in Java needs to be compiled into a program and a Java framework is necessary to be able to run it.
    - In other words, expect for their names, they’re completely different.
- ...

Nobody expects recruiters to know all technical languages in detail. The point here is: if you’re hiring an android developer, you should not hire someone who only has interest in PHP. The technologies differ in many ways and you cannot know all of them at the same time. But if they knew something about IT, they would know...

## They are really aggressive
When you’re working for over a year in this sector and you have a nice LinkedIN profile, recruiters spam the freak out of you. Mostly, I get around three job offers a week. Most of those job offers are not targeted to me personally. It is just a bot, or even worse, someone manually copy pasting job offers and just changing the name over and over again. It often happens that they make mistakes in changing the name. I have been ‘Jonathan’, some French guy and went through other identity crises.
In case you don’t reply that often on LinkedIN, they also find ways to track down your phone number and call you whenever fits best to them. One day, when I was still working at Showpad, I got a call during to day asking me if I would consider a career switch.
Their mindset just seems to be focussed on ‘the more we contact, the more chances we have', which is definitely not the case.

## Experience equals age (apparently)
In most companies I worked, we really dislike titles as ‘junior’, ‘medior’ and ‘senior’. What defines that someone is a medior, a senior or still a junior? I never figured it out completely.
My best guess is that it is related to your age. Recruiters love to know how old you are, how long you’ve been working in the field and try to negotiate your wage down based on it. That’s one of the reasons they stalk young people that often.
In my opinion, skills are very relative and are definitely not related to how old you are. Take me for example: I am a 23 year old disaster, I don’t know a lot in general, but I do know a lot about JavaScript. I started using it for the first time when I was twelve and followed the technology ever since. I also worked at three companies using Angular or React and learned a lot of best practices. Besides that, I went to a lot of meetups, did a lot of experiments and watched some educational movies in my free time. I would never count as a ‘senior’ or ‘medior’ in any JavaScript related job application, as I am only 23 and only work in the field for two years.
Someone working for 5 years as a JAVA software analyst, 9-to-5 and having no difference in experience, could be considered a ‘senior web developer’ as he has ‘more experience in the field'.

## Do you play soccer?
In case you are desperate enough getting a job and plan an interview this way, keep in mind that you’re just slowly navigating through hell. In case of interest, they first want to call you over the phone. Then you need to talk about yourself and answer some other questions that seem to be completely irrelevant.

The questions they ask are, in their opinion, completely relevant. Since they cannot judge you on your technical skills (they will never check portfolio’s, GitHub, StackOverflow…), they test you 100% on something way more important: soft skills. I used to be questioned a lot whether I liked playing soccer or not. One day I also found out why they asked that particular question. Apparently it’s psychological. Soccer is a team sport and most players need to be able to work in team pretty well. Seems like a logical explanation, however, not everyone likes playing soccer...

To be fair, some soft skills such as communication and language are important to be able to work in a company. In my opinion, recruiters are just taking it way too far. Wearing a suit doesn’t make you a better coder and your experience in a youth club as a child won’t probably help you as a developer.

## They cost a lot of money
Unlike sunshine, using a recruitment service isn’t free. It even costs a lot of money for a service that in matter of fact is only connecting people. A lot of companies decide to do their own recruitment, which is actually way more powerful than using an external service. Developers like me are interested in working in a particular company and don’t want the extra hassle. While employers are paying with money, candidates are paying with time. Time that can never be earned back.

After writing this blog, I just want to mark the word ‘most’ in the title. There are, luckily enough, specialised recruitment agencies coming up who do know their shit and are even able to take technical tests. Unfortunately, this is just a minority and mostly in other countries.
As a developer myself, I still recommend companies and candidates to get in touch directly. It’s way easier, takes less time, almost no money and is definitely less stressful for both.
